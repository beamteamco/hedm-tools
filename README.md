# hedm-tools

A collection of utility scripts to postprocess and visualize high energy diffraction microscopy (HEDM) data processed
using APS MIDAS and Lawrence Livermore heXRD codes.

1. APS-HEDM-tools: Scripts for postprocessing APS data. These scripts are written by Jun-Sang Park and others at APS.
2. Aps-grain-visualization: Visualizing grains reconstructed using the APS MIDAS code. Scripts contributed by the Stebner group at Colorado School of Mines.
3. heXRD-postprocess: Visualization and analysis scripts for the grains reconstructed using the heXRD code. Contributed by the Stebner group at Colorado School of Mines.
4. mesh-generation: Scripts for creating FEM meshes from the grain center of mass information obtained from APS MIDAS or heXRD codes. Currently uses Neper tessellation software. Scripts contributed by Stebner group at Colorado School of Mines.
